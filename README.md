# ..Modlishka..
[It is unofficial docker image for Modlishka project](https://github.com/drk1wi/Modlishka)

More about project

Modlishka is a flexible and powerful reverse proxy, that will take your phishing campaigns to the next level (with minimal effort required from your side). 
 
Enjoy :-)


Features
--------

Some of the most important 'Modlishka' features :

-   Support for majority of 2FA authentication schemes (by design).
-   No website templates (just point Modlishka to the target domain - in most cases, it will be handled automatically).
-   Full control of "cross" origin TLS traffic flow from your victims browsers (through custom new techniques).
-   Flexible  and easily configurable phishing scenarios through configuration options.
-   Pattern based JavaScript payload injection.
-   Striping website from all encryption and security headers (back to 90's MITM style). 
-   User credential harvesting (with context based on URL parameter passed identifiers).
-   Can be extended with your ideas through plugins.
-   Stateless design. Can be scaled up easily for an arbitrary number of users - ex. through a DNS load balancer.
-   Web panel with a summary of collected credentials and user session impersonation (beta).
-   Written in Go.
