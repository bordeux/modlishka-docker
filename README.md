# ..Modlishka..

Modlishka is a flexible and powerful reverse proxy, that will take your phishing campaigns to the next level. 

It was realeased with an aim to:
- help penetration testers to carry out an effective phishing campaign and reinforce the fact that **serious** threat can arise from phishing.
- show current 2FA weaknesses, so adequate security solutions can be created and implemented soon.
- raise community awareness about modern phishing techniques and strategies.
- support other open source projects that require a universal reverse proxy.

Enjoy :-)


Features
--------

Some of the most important 'Modlishka' features :

-   Support for majority of 2FA authentication schemes (by design).
-   No website templates (just point Modlishka to the target domain - in most cases, it will be handled automatically).
-   Full control of "cross" origin TLS traffic flow from your victims browsers (through custom new techniques).
-   Flexible  and easily configurable phishing scenarios through configuration options.
-   Pattern based JavaScript payload injection.
-   Striping website from all encryption and security headers (back to 90's MITM style). 
-   User credential harvesting (with context based on URL parameter passed identifiers).
-   Can be extended with your ideas through plugins.
-   Stateless design. Can be scaled up easily for an arbitrary number of users - ex. through a DNS load balancer.
-   Web panel with a summary of collected credentials and user session impersonation (beta).
-   Backdoor free ;-).
-   Written in Go.
